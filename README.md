# ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain ü§ù Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)

This repository provides LangChain components for various OCI services. It aims to replace and expand upon the existing LangChain OCI components found in the `langchain-community` package in the LangChain repository.

## Features

- **LLMs**: Includes LLM classes for OCI services like [Generative AI](https://cloud.oracle.com/ai-services/generative-ai) and [ModelDeployment Endpoints](https://cloud.oracle.com/ai-services/model-deployment), allowing you to leverage their language models within LangChain.
- **Agents**: Includes Runnables to support [Oracle Generative AI Agents](https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai/agents/), allowing you to leverage Generative AI Agents within LangChain and LangGraph.
- **More to come**: This repository will continue to expand and offer additional components for various OCI services as development progresses.

**Note**: This repository will replace all OCI integrations currently present in the `langchain-community` package. Users are encouraged to migrate to this repository as soon as possible.
